# CAMIN-DMOS: Multimodal Learning for Psychophysiological Insights in Physical Activity and Sports

## Overview

**CAMIN-DMOS** (Cross-Attention Multimodal Integration Network with Dynamic Multimodal Optimization Strategy) is a novel framework designed for analyzing complex psychophysiological interactions in sports and physical activity. By integrating data from multiple sources such as video, sensor signals, and physiological measurements, it enhances our understanding of human performance and responses. 

Traditional unimodal or loosely integrated approaches struggle to capture intricate interdependencies across modalities, leading to suboptimal insights. CAMIN-DMOS addresses these challenges by utilizing:

- **Cross-Attention Multimodal Integration Network (CAMIN)**: Leverages modality-specific encoders and cross-attention mechanisms to model interdependencies between modalities while preserving their unique characteristics.
- **Dynamic Multimodal Optimization Strategy (DMOS)**: Employs adaptive weighting, redundancy-aware feature selection, and uncertainty-guided learning to ensure robust and scalable performance, even in scenarios with missing or noisy modalities.

## Features

- **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Combines video, sensor, and physiological data for holistic psychophysiological analysis.
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: Captures intricate interdependencies between different modalities.
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Adjusts feature importance dynamically to optimize learning.
- **Robust to Noisy/Missing Data**: Ensures high performance in real-world conditions.
- **Scalability**: Designed for large-scale sports and physical activity datasets.

## Installation

To use CAMIN-DMOS, follow these steps:

```sh
